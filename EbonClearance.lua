-- Shared namespace for the addon. WoW passes (addonName, namespaceTable) as
-- the varargs to every .lua file in an addon; the same table is shared
-- across files. NS exists from the first stage of the multi-release file
-- split planned in docs/CODE_REVIEW.md item 4 ("File split"). Stage 1
-- (this commit) bootstraps the namespace without moving any code -
-- existing file-scope locals stay as upvalue captures, and module-level
-- helpers that need to be reachable from future split files get mirrored
-- onto NS as the split progresses. Reading or writing NS.foo from any
-- future EbonClearance_*.lua file picks up the same table this assignment
-- creates. `select(2, ...)` is used instead of `local addonName, NS = ...`
-- because the main chunk is already at Lua 5.1's 200-locals cap; capturing
-- only the namespace (and not the addon name string, which we don't use)
-- spends one slot instead of two.
local NS = select(2, ...)

-- TARGET_NAME / PET_NAME hold the live display names of the two Project
-- Ebonhold companion NPCs. The defaults below are the enUS strings the
-- addon shipped with; v2.9.0 made them user-configurable via DB.merchantName
-- / DB.scavengerName so a realm with a renamed or localised pet can be
-- driven without forking. EnsureDB (and EC_compCache.refreshNames for UI
-- edits) writes back into these locals every time DB is re-read, and
-- PET_NAME_LC is recomputed alongside. Companion lookup is now ID-first via the cache
-- declared in the forward-decl block; the spellID 600126 fallback in
-- FindGoblinMerchantIndex remains the safety net for first-run resolution
-- when the cache is empty AND the merchant has been renamed in DB.

-- Build-time version. The release workflow's sed rule rewrites the

-- pattern fixed in v2.13.2), so the in-game UI surfaces (settings
-- panel header, bug-report builder, anything routed through EC_GetVersion)
-- always match the .toc on a release build. Dev checkouts keep
-- whatever real version the last release shipped; EC_GetVersion's
-- match check accepts any `^v%d+%.%d+%.%d+` value and short-circuits
-- to it. The fallback to GetAddOnMetadata exists for the legacy
-- placeholder case but is no longer reached on the current workflow.
-- Carrying the version here means a stale .toc cache (WoW only re-reads
-- .toc files on full client restart, not /reload) cannot make the displayed
-- version lie on a release build. The CI test in
-- tests/test_layout_reactivity.lua asserts this constant matches the
-- .toc Version field so any future drift fails CI before shipping.

-- v2.21.0: Fast Loot driver. Replaces v2.16.0's tight-loop drain
-- (which fired N LootSlot calls in one frame and risked anti-flood
-- disconnect on busy 3.3.5a private servers) with a queue + OnUpdate
-- throttle: on LOOT_READY, the slot indices are pushed into
-- EC_lootQueue.slots and the OnUpdate driver below drains one slot
-- every EC_LOOT_QUEUE_DELAY seconds. Each pop re-validates the slot
-- and pre-checks bag space before calling LootSlot. The 0.3 s
-- LOOT_READY debounce from v2.16.0 is gone - re-populating the queue
-- on a fresh LOOT_READY is idempotent (wipe + refill).
--
-- The "auto-loot is effectively on right now?" check is unchanged
-- from v2.16.0: autoLootDefault is the CVar setting, AUTOLOOTTOGGLE
-- is the modifier key (typically Shift) that inverts auto-loot for
-- one interaction. When the CVar's value matches whether the
-- modifier is held, auto-loot is OFF for this loot (user is
-- explicitly opting OUT - or didn't opt IN); when they differ,
-- auto-loot is ON. Skip when off so the user keeps the standard
-- loot window for selective looting.
--
-- BoP-bind auto-confirm (also v2.16.0) is unchanged: the
-- hooksecurefunc on LootSlot fires whether the call comes from the
-- old tight loop or the new queue. Fast Loot users still don't see
-- the bind popup.

-- three methods: `getRow(index)` mints or returns a pooled row frame
-- with a Remove button + label FontString, `hideAllRows()` hides every
-- currently active row and resets the count, `setActiveRows(n)` lets
-- the caller (Refresh) report how many rows are now displayed so the
-- next hideAllRows knows the upper bound.
--
-- Why expose setActiveRows: in the inline-CreateListUI version the
-- Refresh closure mutated `activeRows` directly as an upvalue. After
-- extraction the state lives inside the factory's closure, so Refresh
-- needs an explicit setter. Same data flow, just routed through a
-- method call.
--
-- Row layout: 22 px tall, full width via TOPLEFT/TOPRIGHT anchors set
-- by Refresh on each placement. Remove button is right-anchored, label
-- text fills the gap between row's left edge and the button.
