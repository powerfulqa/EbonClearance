-- Curated three-section reference panel: troubleshooting FAQ, sell-
-- decision gate explanations, and tooltip-label meanings. Entries live
-- in a file-scope EC_HELP_ENTRIES table; section markers in the list
-- drive the build's section grouping + collapsible state.
--
-- Design spec: docs/specs/2026-05-26-help-faq-panel-design.md
--
-- Cross-file dependencies (resolved lazily at call time):
--   * NS.compCache (EC_compCache.initPanel, setPanelWidth, etc.)
--   * NS.DB         (per-character SavedVariables, captured at OnShow)
--   * NS.MakeHeader / NS.MakeLabel (panel-text primitives)
--   * NS.FitScrollContent (scroll-content height fitter)
--   * NS.EC_WrapPanelInScrollFrame (scroll-wrap helper)

-- Ordered flat list. Two entry kinds:
--   * Section marker: { section = "<key>", title = "<display>" }
--   * Content entry:  { q = "<question/topic>", a = "<answer>", panel = "<frameName>" }
-- The build callback walks this list; section markers set the current
-- collapse-state group, content entries render between markers.
-- panel field is optional - when present, an `Open <name>` button
-- jumps to that Interface Options panel.

-- NS.OpenHelpEntry(entryId): deep-link from a settings panel into the
-- Help panel at a specific entry. Settings panels register [?] icons
-- via NS.AddHelpIcon (EbonClearance_PanelWidgets.lua); the icon's
-- OnClick calls this function with the entry's stable id.
--
-- Behaviour:
--   1. Find the section that owns this entry (walk EC_HELP_ENTRIES) and
--      set DB.helpSectionsCollapsed[ownerSection] = false so the section
--      auto-expands when the panel renders.
--   2. Call InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory(HelpPanel) twice (the
--      standard 3.3.5a workaround for the open-to-sub-panel bug where
--      the first call sometimes lands on the parent category). This
--      fires OnShow synchronously and refreshLayout positions widgets.
--   3. Increment HelpPanel._scrollGeneration and capture it in a closure.
--      Every delayed task (scroll, flash) checks its captured generation
--      against the current one and no-ops if a subsequent OpenHelpEntry
--      has superseded it.
--   4. Schedule the scroll + flash via NS.Delay(0.7s). By then both
--      FitScrollContent ticks (0.1s + 0.5s) have settled the outer scroll
--      content's height so GetVerticalScrollRange is correct. The scroll
--      math uses `currentScroll + (scrollTop - widgetTop)` so it produces
--      the right absolute scroll value regardless of where the panel
--      currently sits. The flash swaps the q FontString's inline yellow
--      |cffffff00 for bright cyan |cff00ffff for ~0.6s, then restores.
--
-- refreshLayout is intentionally NOT involved in the deep-link side
-- effects - it just positions widgets and fits the scroll content. All
-- scroll/flash state lives here in the closure, gated by the generation
-- counter.
--
-- If entryId is nil or no matching entry exists, the panel still opens
-- (no scroll / flash). Safe failure mode for typos and stale ids.
-- Locate the q FontString for a given entry id. renderItems carries the
-- id directly on each q/a entry (assigned at build time), so this is
-- now a single linear walk - no more counting indices through two
-- parallel lists. Returns nil if the panel hasn't been built yet OR
