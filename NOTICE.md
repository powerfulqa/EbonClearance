# Notice - prior art and convergent patterns

This file documents the design lineage of EbonClearance honestly, so
that any future "they copied us" or "you copied them" claim has a
record to refer to. Convergence on similar shapes is acknowledged
where it exists; originality is not claimed where the pattern is
shared with the broader WoW 3.3.5a addon ecosystem.

## Convergent patterns in the 3.3.5a niche

EbonClearance ships in a niche that several other addons also
target: automated inventory management for a single private server,
sharing a small set of WoW 3.3.5a APIs and a single core gameplay
loop (loot, summon, sell, repair, repeat). Heavy feature parity
between addons in this niche - auto-loot cycles, companion-pet
management, mount-aware behaviour, stuck-detection heuristics,
batched selling with disconnect-prevention caps, two-scope item
lists, hand-rolled minimap buttons, three-keybind `Bindings.xml`
files, and so on - reflects that small API surface and that single
loop converging on broadly similar solutions. Convergence on the
same shape is not, in itself, evidence of copying in either
direction.

## Related projects in the PE auto-vendor niche

Two other addons solve overlapping problems in the same niche:

- [AutoDelete](https://github.com/disarrayed/AutoDelete) (MIT-licensed) -
  whitelist + delete + sell hybrid with a tabbed custom-window UI, an
  Auto-Invite system, and ElvUI bag drag-buttons. Ships features like
  `autoAddEquipped` (sync currently-equipped gear to a Keep list +
  reactive PLAYER_EQUIPMENT_CHANGED), `summonOnlyInCombat`, and a
  first-run welcome popup. Several of these landed in AutoDelete's
  v3.10-v3.18 series (April 25 - May 2, 2026), in some cases days
  before EbonClearance's equivalents shipped (notably `autoAddEquipped`,
  May 2 in AutoDelete vs May 4 in EC v2.10.0).

  EbonClearance's equivalents were written independently against the
  same Blizzard 3.3.5a API surface. The 1-19 inventory slot walk with
  shirt+tabard skip, the one-shot-at-toggle-flip + reactive-event
  split, and the quiet-bulk-vs-chatty-reactive print pattern are all
  shapes the API itself forces; the code that implements them in EC
  uses different storage fields (`blacklistAuto` vs `whitelistText`),
  different add helpers (`EC_AddItemToList` vs `AddLineIfMissing`),
  and different print formatting, and EC carries v2.12.0 origin-tag
  extensions (`"equipped"` / `"upgrade"`) that AutoDelete does not.
  EC's `summonOnlyOutOfCombat` field is the polar opposite of
  AutoDelete's `summonOnlyInCombat`: AutoDelete gates auto-summons
  to fire only while in combat (farming-mode toggle); EC gates them
  to fire only while out of combat (don't burn a GCD mid-rotation).

- [AutoLoot](https://github.com/Veronica-Vasilieva/AutoLoot) (license
  per upstream repo) - smaller, blacklist-first auto-vendor with a
  state-machine companion cycle and a custom standalone window.
  Different scope and architecture from EC; no overlapping
  implementation patterns.

Cross-pollination of ideas in a small private-server addon ecosystem
is normal and acknowledged. Where EbonClearance was inspired by an
idea visible in another addon's behaviour, the implementation was
written from scratch against the Blizzard API; verbatim code from
another addon is not present in this codebase. Anyone wishing to
verify can clone the EC repository and review the commit log
alongside the cited competitor source.

The acknowledgement runs both ways. AutoDelete's v3.20 README (May
2026) includes a `Credits` section noting "AutoDelete has been
re-implemented in part by EbonClearance" and "We appreciate the
shoutouts in their source comments", reciprocating the source-comment
mentions of AutoDelete that have been present in EC's code since the
early `EbonholdStuff` fork. Both projects ship under their own
licences (AutoDelete: MIT; EbonClearance: source-available attribution
licence; see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) and both are written as original
codebases against the shared Blizzard 3.3.5a API. Where a feature
shape converges (e.g. a "Process Bags" panel grouping disenchant /
mill / prospect / open under one window), the implementations are
independent; the convergence reflects the small API surface and the
specific gameplay loop both addons are solving for.

## Community contributions

Where players have shared modifications, prototypes, or companion
addons that informed EC's design, the credit is recorded here.

**Ivo (v2.37.0).** Ivo shared his personally-modified EC fork plus a
small standalone companion addon he wrote for his own use, and gave
permission for the patterns to be adapted back into upstream. Three
v2.37.0 features started from his work:

- **Affix-pipeline event log.** The `AffixDebugDump` structured event
  logger in `EbonClearance_Protection.lua`, with the six probe sites
  along the affix-decision pipeline and the `/ec affixdebug` slash
  sub-command, is adapted from Ivo's diagnostic prototype. The EC
  implementation broadens the scope (account-wide flag, slash UX,
  copyable dump window, `/ec bugreport` integration) but the core
  shape - "log the affix pipeline's decisions to SavedVariables so a
  player who hits a divergence can ship the structured trail" - is
  his idea.

- **"Already known by this character" tooltip annotation.** His
  companion addon detected already-learned tomes / recipes via a
  hidden tooltip scan for `ITEM_SPELL_KNOWN`. EC already had the
  underlying detection (`tomeIsKnownCache`) for its protection rules;
  Ivo's contribution is the idea of surfacing that detection as a
  user-visible cue independent of the protection toggles. EC's
  implementation uses the tooltip-annotation surface (allowed under
  the project's "no icon overlays on bag items" rule) rather than
  the icon-overlay form his prototype used.

- **Item-level overlay on equippable gear slots.** Same idea, similar
  rendering shape (quality-coloured text in the bottom-right corner
  with the equipLoc whitelist filter). The EC implementation adds an
  opt-in master toggle with three independently togglable surface
  sub-toggles (bags / paperdoll / merchant) and a font-size slider,
  ships the master toggle defaulting off so existing players pick up
  no visual change without action, and narrows the project's prior
  "no icon overlays" rule to allow informational text overlays gated
  behind explicit player opt-in.

Thanks Ivo. The companion addon he wrote was treated as inspiration
only; no code from it was copied into EC verbatim, and the EC
implementations were written against the same Blizzard 3.3.5a APIs
that the prototype used. His prototype remains entirely his own work
to ship or not, separate from EC's release schedule.

## Source-available licence pattern

EbonClearance ships under a custom **source-available attribution
licence**. The structural shape (Grant / Attribution / No-Rebrand /
Forks / Non-commercial / No-Warranty / Termination / Severability)
follows similar source-available licences that have appeared in the
3.3.5a private-server addon ecosystem before this one. EbonClearance
does not claim its licence structure is original; the structure was
adopted because it is the right shape for the same anti-rebrand
pressure other addons in this scene are reacting to.

---

## Provenance globals pattern

EbonClearance writes the following globals at addon load:

```
EBONCLEARANCE_IDENT       = "EbonClearance"
EBONCLEARANCE_AUTHOR      = "Serv"
EBONCLEARANCE_ORIGIN      = "<canonical github url>"
__EbonClearance_origin    = "<canonical github url>"
__EbonClearance_author    = "Serv"
__EbonClearance_watermark = "<derived hex hash>"
```

The `__<addon>_origin` / `__<addon>_author` form (double-underscore
prefix, addon name, role suffix) is a pattern that has appeared in
other 3.3.5a addons before this one. EbonClearance does not claim
the pattern is original; it is deliberately compatible with
something the broader scene is settling on for the same anti-rebrand
reasons.

The `__EbonClearance_watermark` global and the export-string
fingerprint suffix (`;fp=<6 hex>`) are EbonClearance-specific. See
[`docs/ADDON_GUIDE.md`](docs/ADDON_GUIDE.md) "Fingerprint and
watermark" section for the convention and how to verify the value.

## The honest summary

- **Core gameplay loop**: developed independently with full public
  commit history.
- **Licence structure and provenance globals**: adopted patterns
  that exist elsewhere in the 3.3.5a addon ecosystem with
  acknowledgement (this file), not original to this project.
- **Fingerprint and watermark mechanism**: specific to this project.
