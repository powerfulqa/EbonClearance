ne# EbonClearance - Addon Development Guide

**Read this first if you are an AI agent or new contributor touching
this codebase.** It is prescriptive: when the guide and a random
internet tutorial disagree, follow the guide.

## TL;DR conventions

1. **Client target is WoW 3.3.5a (Interface 30300 / WotLK / Lua 5.1).**
   Do not copy-paste retail code. APIs like `C_Timer`, `C_Container`,
   and `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED` do not exist here.
2. **Single file.** All code lives in `EbonClearance.lua`. Do not split
   into modules unless explicitly asked - see "When to split" below.
3. **Namespace via `EC_` prefixed locals.** There is no addon table.
   Nearly everything is `local`; the only intentional globals are the
   saved-variable tables (`EbonClearanceDB`, `EbonClearanceAccountDB`),
   the slash-command handles, the keybinding header / name strings
   (`BINDING_HEADER_EBONCLEARANCE`, `BINDING_NAME_EBONCLEARANCE_*`), the
   handlers wired from `Bindings.xml` (`EbonClearance_ToggleSettings`,
   `EbonClearance_ToggleEnabled`, `EbonClearance_ForceSell`), and the
   provenance globals required by `LICENSE` §2 (`EBONCLEARANCE_IDENT`,
   `EBONCLEARANCE_AUTHOR`, `EBONCLEARANCE_ORIGIN`,
   `__EbonClearance_origin`, `__EbonClearance_author`).
4. **State machine uses `STATE.*` constants**, never raw strings. See
   `STATE = { IDLE, LOOTING, WAITING_MERCHANT, SELLING }` in the file.
5. **Cache hot WoW API globals at file top**, then use the locals on
   hot paths (vendor loop, bag scans, OnUpdate callbacks).
6. **One event-dispatch frame.** All events hang off `f` at the bottom
   of `EbonClearance.lua`. Do not create new event frames for new events
   - add to the dispatch table.
7. **Print through `PrintNice` or `PrintNicef`.** Never call
   `DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage` directly outside those helpers.
8. **Saved variables always go through `EnsureDB()`.** New fields must
   default without breaking an existing `EbonClearanceDB` table.
9. **Interface Options panels are idempotent via `self.inited`.** Every
   panel's OnShow does the "if inited then refresh-only; return" dance.
10. **No external libraries.** No Ace3, no LibStub, no LDB. See the
    Ace3 decision record below for the reasoning and escape hatch.
11. **Doc links never use `#L<n>` line anchors.** Link to the file by
    name (e.g. `[CreateListUI](../EbonClearance.lua)`) and let readers
    `grep` for the symbol. Line numbers shift on every refactor; symbol
    names don't.
12. **Do not remove attribution markers.** `LICENSE` §2 lists five
    things every redistribution must preserve: the `## Author:` TOC
    line, the file-header comment block at the top of
    `EbonClearance.lua`, the GUI byline rendered on the main options
    panel, the `EBONCLEARANCE_*` / `__EbonClearance_*` provenance
    globals, and the `LICENSE` file in full. If a refactor would touch
    any of those, leave them alone or update them with care - never
    delete.

## Client target: 3.3.5a

### `.toc` fields we use

## Version: ...
## SavedVariables: EbonClearanceDB, EbonClearanceAccountDB

EbonClearance.lua
Bindings.xml
```

`EbonClearanceDB` is per-character (default for `## SavedVariables`);
`EbonClearanceAccountDB` is account-wide and stores the shared
whitelist that gets unioned at sell time. If you ever add a
character-scoped var that should *not* persist across characters in
this account, use `## SavedVariablesPerCharacter`. We do not use
`Dependencies`, `OptionalDeps`, `LoadOnDemand`, or `LoadManagers`.

`Bindings.xml` declares the three bindable actions and is loaded
straight after the Lua. Do not move bindings into Lua - WoW expects
them in XML at addon-load time.

### Lua 5.1 constraints

- No `goto` / labels.
- No integer division operator (`//`) - use `math.floor(a / b)`.
- No `bit32`; use the built-in `bit` library (`bit.band`, `bit.bor`, etc).
- No `string.pack`, no `utf8` library.
- `ipairs` stops at the first nil; use `pairs` for sparse tables.

## Architecture

### File layout

One file, roughly in this order:
- File header comment block (required by LICENSE §2(b); do not remove).
- Constants and cached API upvalues (top).
- Provenance globals (`EBONCLEARANCE_IDENT/AUTHOR/ORIGIN`, plus two
  `__EbonClearance_*` aliases - required by LICENSE §2(d)).
- Greedy Scavenger chat filters (`EC_GreedyEventFilter`,
  `EC_InstallGreedyMuteOnce`, `ApplyGreedyChatFilter`).
- Speech-bubble killer (`EC_bubbleFrame`).
- SavedVariable bootstrap (`EnsureDB`, `EnsureAccountDB`,
  `EC_GetListTable` list-name resolver, `EC_ExtraListTables`).
- Profile / bag / pet / merchant helpers.
- State machine constants (`STATE`).
- Timers (`EC_Delay`, `EC_delayFrame`).
- Session-stats table (`EC_session`) and `EC_ResetSession`.
- Pet check OnUpdate and auto-loot cycle (`EC_petCheckFrame`).
- Vendor loop (`BuildQueue`, `DoNextAction`, `worker`).
- UI: `CreateListUI` (search / sort / "Add matching in bags" row baked
  in), minimap button, dormant `EC_CreateVendorButton`,
  `StaticPopupDialogs` for confirmation, Interface Options panels
  (Main, Merchant Settings - includes the quality threshold,
  Whitelist - Character, Whitelist - Account, Profiles, Import/Export,
  Deletion List, Blacklist - Keep, Scavenger Settings, Character
  Settings).
- `EC_AddScanByQualityRow` helper used by both whitelist panels.
- Export / import / bug report.
- List-conflict helpers (`EC_ScanListConflicts`,
  `EC_PrintConflictReport`, `EC_ApplyCleanResolution`).
- Keybinding header / name strings and the three
  `EbonClearance_*` global handlers (called from `Bindings.xml`).
- Event dispatch (bottom) and slash commands (`/ec`, `/ec profile ...`,
  `/ec clean [apply]`, `/ec bugreport`, `/ecdebug`).

Approximate ordering - do not reshuffle unless splitting the file.

### The event hub

At the bottom of the file, one `CreateFrame("Frame")` registers every
event and dispatches via a switch on `event`. Adding a new event is a
two-liner: `f:RegisterEvent("NEW_EVENT")` and a branch in the OnEvent
handler. Do **not** add a second event frame for "your feature."

Currently registered: `ADDON_LOADED`, `PLAYER_LOGOUT`, `PLAYER_LOGIN`,
`PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, `MERCHANT_SHOW`, `MERCHANT_CLOSED`,
`UNIT_AURA` (player-filtered when `RegisterUnitEvent` is available),
and `BAG_UPDATE`. The `BAG_UPDATE` branch dispatches to two helpers
in priority order: `EC_HandleBagFullForCycle` (auto-loot cycle's
threshold trigger; v2.2.0) and then `EC_HandleAutoOpenContainers`
(opens "Right Click to Open" containers; v2.3.0). The auto-open
helper yields to the vendor cycle via the `running` guard, so they
never collide.

### Saved variables shape

`EbonClearanceDB` is one flat table per character. Fields fall into
four groups:

- **Lists**: `whitelist`, `blacklist`, `deleteList`, `enableOnlyListedChars`.
- **Profiles**: `whitelistProfiles`, `blacklistProfiles`, `activeProfileName`.
- **Settings**: `enabled`, `summonGreedy`, `summonDelay`,
  `vendorInterval`, `maxItemsPerRun`, `fastMode`, `merchantMode`,
  `autoLootCycle`, `bagFullThreshold`, `autoOpenContainers`,
  `repairGear`, `keepBagsOpen`, `muteGreedy`, `hideGreedyChat`,
  `hideGreedyBubbles`, `enableDeletion`, `qualityRules` (v2.5.0+;
  per-rarity table, see below), `vendorBtnShown`
  (and `vendorBtnX`, `vendorBtnY`, `vendorBtnPoint`, `vendorBtnRelPoint`
  - dormant; see the `EC_CreateVendorButton` block).
  `fastMode` (v2.2.0+) pins the per-item interval to the 0.05 s floor
  and doubles the per-run cap; consume via `EC_EffectiveVendorInterval`
  / `EC_EffectiveMaxItemsPerRun`, never read it directly on hot paths.
  `qualityRules` (v2.5.0+) is a table indexed by quality (1=White,
  2=Green, 3=Blue, 4=Epic added in v2.8.0) with
  `{ enabled = bool, maxILvl = number }` per rarity; `maxILvl == 0`
  means no cap. When `maxILvl > 0` the cap only filters items with a
  non-empty `equipLoc` (i.e. items that display "Item Level: N" on
  their tooltip); trade goods, reagents, and consumables - even if
  `GetItemInfo` returns a non-zero internal itemLevel - are protected.
  Replaces the v2.3.x `whitelistMinQuality` / `whitelistQualityEnabled`
  pair (kept on the table for one release for rollback). If you ever
  add a fifth tier (Legendary), extend the loop in `EnsureDB` plus the
  three `quality >= 1 and quality <= 4` checks in `EC_IsSellable`,
  `EC_AnnotateTooltip`, and the `/ecdebug` bag scan, plus the
  per-rarity row builder in the Merchant Settings panel.
- **Stats**: `totalCopper`, `totalItemsSold`, `totalItemsDeleted`,
  `totalRepairs`, `totalRepairCopper`, `soldItemCounts`,
  `deletedItemCounts`, `inventoryWorthTotal`, `inventoryWorthCount`.
- **UI**: `minimapButtonAngle`, `allowedChars`.

`EbonClearanceAccountDB` is a separate, account-wide table holding only
`{ whitelist = { [itemID] = true, ... } }`. It is bootstrapped by
`EnsureAccountDB()` (called from `EnsureDB()`) and exposed to
`CreateListUI` via the `EC_GetListTable` resolver under the name
`accountWhitelist`. Sell-time consultation is a union of the per-char
and account whitelists.

In-memory only (not saved): `EC_session = { copper, sold, deleted,
repairs, repairCopper }`. Reset by the Reset Session button on the main
page or on `/reload`.

`EnsureDB()` is the **only** place defaults are written. Adding a new
setting means: pick the group, add a default line inside `EnsureDB()`,
and make sure it's `nil`-tolerant (`DB.myField or default`).

## Required patterns

### Locals everywhere

```lua
local function DoThing()  -- good
function DoThing()        -- bad - creates a global
```

Check with `luacheck EbonClearance.lua`; the W111/W112 family catches
this.

### Cached API globals

The block at the top of the file caches hot API functions:

```lua
local GetItemInfo = GetItemInfo
local GetContainerItemID = GetContainerItemID
-- ...and the rest of the bag / merchant / companion API
```

When you use one of these on a hot path, you are using the local
upvalue, which is a single register read rather than a `_G` hash
lookup. If you add new hot-path API calls, add them to the cache.

### State transitions

```lua
EC_lootCycleState = STATE.LOOTING          -- good
EC_lootCycleState = "looting"              -- bad - typos become silent
if EC_lootCycleState == STATE.IDLE then    -- good
```

A typo in a string state is a silent bug (the comparison fails, the
transition never fires). A typo in `STATE.XYZ` is a nil-compare that
fails closed and usually crashes loudly.

### Chat output

```lua
PrintNice("Hello")                          -- static string
PrintNicef("Sold %d items for %s", n, g)    -- formatted
-- never:
DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("[EbonClearance] ...")
```

The prefix/colour are owned by `PrintNice`. Direct `AddMessage` calls
drift the prefix over time.

### Event handler

Add to the hub's switch, do not spawn a new frame:

```lua
-- In the bottom event handler:
elseif event == "BAG_UPDATE" then
    -- new branch
```

## UI conventions

### Interface Options panels

Pattern for every panel:

```lua
local MyPanel = CreateFrame("Frame", "EbonClearanceOptionsMy",
    InterfaceOptionsFramePanelContainer)
MyPanel.name = "My Panel"
MyPanel.parent = "EbonClearance"           -- nest under main category

MyPanel:SetScript("OnShow", function(self)
    EnsureDB()
    EC_UpdatePanelWidth()
    if self.inited then
        -- refresh dynamic widgets from DB here, then
        return
    end
    self.inited = true
    -- static widget creation (called exactly once)
end)

InterfaceOptions_AddCategory(MyPanel)
```

### Colour palette

Use the existing palette - do not invent new shades:

| Colour code  | Meaning         |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `\|cff4db8ff` | Addon title     |
| `\|cffb6ffb6` | Success / good  |
| `\|cffff4444` | Error / bad     |
| `\|cffffb84d` | Warning / note  |
| `\|cffffff00` | Emphasis yellow |
| `\|cff7fbfff` | Chat prefix     |
| `\|cff888888` | Muted / caption |

## Performance rules for 3.3.5a

- **Never do a full bag scan per frame.** OnUpdate scripts that run
  every frame must early-return unless an accumulator threshold
  (`elapsed`, interval counter) has elapsed. See `EC_petCheckFrame`
  for the canonical 5-second-tick pattern.
- **`GetItemInfo` returns `nil` for uncached items.** The canonical
  warm-up is a hidden `GameTooltip:SetHyperlink()` which forces the
  client to request the item data. After a short delay, `GetItemInfo`
  will return the real values. `CreateListUI` uses this pattern.
- **Vendor interval floor is 0.05s.** The server disconnects addons
  that hammer the merchant. Do not reduce the floor in
  `DB.vendorInterval` bounds.
- **`wipe(t)` is preferred over `t = {}`** when clearing a table that
  has external references (saved variables, widgets holding a ref).

## Saved variables

Always go through `EnsureDB()`. The function is idempotent and migrates
the legacy `EbonholdStuffDB` on first run. Adding a new field:

```lua
if type(DB.myNewField) ~= "number" then DB.myNewField = 0.5 end
```

Pick the type-tolerant form (`type(...) ~= "expected"`) so manually-
edited saved variables don't corrupt the addon.

Do **not** hard-delete fields when you rename; leave a migration:

```lua
if DB.oldName ~= nil and DB.newName == nil then
    DB.newName = DB.oldName
    DB.oldName = nil
end
```

## Ace3 - decision record

**We do not embed Ace3 in EbonClearance.** Reasoning:

- The addon works and is stable. A library migration is a rewrite, not
  a refactor.
- Ace3 embed is ~200KB of code for an addon that uses maybe 10% of
  the surface.
- 3.3.5a private servers sometimes gate on file sizes or forbid certain
  embedded libs. Shipping plain Lua avoids that friction.

If we ever did migrate, the minimum-viable Ace3 stack for this addon
would be:

| Library              | Replaces                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| AceAddon-3.0         | The `ADDON_LOADED` / `PLAYER_LOGIN` dance  |
| AceDB-3.0            | `EnsureDB`, profile handling, per-char DBs |
| AceConfig-3.0 +      | Eight manual `InterfaceOptionsFramePanelContainer` |
| AceConfigDialog-3.0  | panels collapse to one options table       |
| AceTimer-3.0         | The four OnUpdate timer frames             |

Use a WotLK-compatible Ace3 revision (r1196–r1249 era; verify
`## Interface: 30300` on the tagged release before embedding).

**What we steal without embedding.** The *shape* of AceConfig's options
table (`type`, `name`, `desc`, `order`, `get`, `set`) is worth
imitating even in vanilla code. If we rebuild our options UI, structure
it as an AceConfig-style table first - future migration becomes a
mechanical substitution.

## Tooling

### StyLua (formatter)

```
stylua EbonClearance.lua            # rewrite
stylua --check EbonClearance.lua    # CI-style verify
```

Config is `stylua.toml`. 4-space indent, 120-column wrap, double
quotes preferred. Matches the existing file style - adopting it
produces no churn.

### Luacheck (linter)

```
luacheck EbonClearance.lua
```

Config is `.luacheckrc`. Goal is zero warnings. If Luacheck flags a
WoW global we actually use, add it to `read_globals` - don't silence
the whole check.

### Qlty-aligned smell gates

Not wired into CI, but enforce in review:

- Functions over 80 LOC → extract helpers. (OnShow / OnUpdate closures
  may exceed this when building UI; prefer to split the init branch
  into a helper, see `BuildMainPanel`.)
- Nesting depth over 4 → flatten with early-return or extract a
  predicate.
- Argument lists over 5 → pack into an options table.
- Identical or near-identical code blocks over 6 lines → extract. See
  `runImport` (import Merge/Replace dedupe) as the canonical example.

## Slash commands

- `/ec` - open the Interface Options panel.
- `/ec profile list|save|load|delete <name>` - profile management.
- `/ec clean` - report items present on more than one list.
- `/ec clean apply` - auto-resolve list conflicts (precedence:
  blacklist > deleteList > whitelist).
- `/ec bugreport` - diagnostic dump for issue reports.
- `/ecdebug` - debug info plus bag scan.

Key bindings (declared in `Bindings.xml`, handlers near the slash
commands):

- `EBONCLEARANCE_TOGGLE_SETTINGS` → `EbonClearance_ToggleSettings()`.
- `EBONCLEARANCE_TOGGLE_ENABLED` → `EbonClearance_ToggleEnabled()`.
- `EBONCLEARANCE_FORCE_SELL` → `EbonClearance_ForceSell()`.

Slash commands and binding handlers are registered at the very bottom
of `EbonClearance.lua`.

## 3.3.5a gotchas

- **Item links.** The only stable part of the hyperlink is the item ID.
  Parse with `link:match("|Hitem:(%d+)")` - do not parse bonus IDs,
  level info, or the post-Legion modifiers. They don't exist here.
- **No `C_Timer.After`.** Use `EC_Delay(seconds, func)`.
- **`GetContainerItemInfo` return signature.** 3.3.5a returns
  `texture, itemCount, locked, quality, readable, lootable, itemLink`.
  Retail reinvented this call three times. Never copy-paste retail.
- **`ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter` is global.** Once added, the
  filter runs for every ChatFrame. If you install one, track the
  installation with a module-level boolean (`EC_greedyFiltersInstalled`)
  so a `/reload` doesn't double-register.
- **`PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` fires after every zone transition**, not
  just login. Guard expensive one-time work with a `local inited`
  boolean.
- **No `C_Timer`, no `Mixin`, no `SecureHandler` templates** at the
  richness you'd find in retail. If a tutorial assumes those, it's not
  for 3.3.5a.

## Gotchas and refactoring traps

Read this section before touching any of the subsystems below. Each item is
a non-obvious design choice that has silently broken in the past (or would
if you "simplified" it).

### Saved-variable migration order is load-bearing

`EnsureDB()` does two migrations in a specific order that must not be reshuffled:

1. **Legacy rename**: if `EbonholdStuffDB` exists and `EbonClearanceDB` does
   not, rename the former into the latter. This has to happen first because
2. **Profile migration**: when the profile-aware schema first runs, it
   snapshots any existing `DB.whitelist` into an `"Imported"` profile and
   auto-activates it. If the legacy rename hasn't happened yet, `DB.whitelist`
   is empty and the user's pre-profile data is lost.

If you add a new migration, put it with the others at the top of
`EnsureDB()` and write the order dependency into the comment.

### Grey items are always sold, independent of every other setting

In `EC_IsSellable`, three independent predicates (`isJunk`, `qualityPass`,
`whitelistPass`) are ORed together. `isJunk` fires on `quality == 0 and
hasSellPrice`. This means grey items with a positive sell price are *always*
matched -- the quality-threshold toggle and the whitelist have no say.

Do not combine the three passes into "one cleaner check." You will silently
break the grey-always-sold invariant that users and the README rely on. The
only things that can veto a match are `IsEquippedItem(itemID)` and the
blacklist, both of which are safety gates.

### Localisation: `TARGET_NAME` / `PET_NAME` are enUS strings

`TARGET_NAME = "Goblin Merchant"` and `PET_NAME = "Greedy scavenger"` are
compared directly against `creatureName` returned by `GetCompanionInfo`. A
non-enUS realm with localised NPC names would silently fail both lookups.

`FindGoblinMerchantIndex` already has a `spellID == 600126` fallback which
is the localisation escape hatch. If a future user reports "summoning
doesn't work on Ebonhold-EU," add a matching spellID fallback to
`SummonGreedyScavenger` rather than trying to translate the names.

### The `"CRITTER"` companion type covers both pet and merchant

On 3.3.5a, the Goblin Merchant and the Greedy Scavenger both occupy the
`"CRITTER"` companion slot despite one being a vanity pet and the other a
functional merchant. They **cannot coexist**. That's why summoning the
merchant dismisses the Scavenger and vice versa, and why the auto-loot
cycle's `WAITING_MERCHANT` / `SELLING` states explicitly dismiss before
re-summoning.

If you want to add a third `CRITTER` feature, know that it will mutually
exclude with the existing two.

### The auto-loot cycle resets on `MERCHANT_CLOSED`, not before

`EC_lootCycleState` transitions to `IDLE` only when `MERCHANT_CLOSED` fires
(plus the `FinishRun` happy path). If a user dismisses the Goblin Merchant
manually without ever opening the vendor window, the state stays at
`WAITING_MERCHANT` indefinitely, and the 5-second pet-check tick won't
re-summon the Scavenger until either the 8-second reminder timer lapses or
another event resets state.

If you ever add a new "we've given up on this sell" path, also clear
`EC_lootCycleState` to `IDLE` or `LOOTING` explicitly -- don't assume the
normal `MERCHANT_CLOSED` flow will rescue it.

### `EC_Delay` callbacks must surface errors via `geterrorhandler`

The custom `EC_Delay` timer wraps each callback in `pcall`. Without a
follow-up call to `geterrorhandler()(err)`, errors inside delayed callbacks
disappear silently -- which is exactly what hid the v2.0.13 scoping bugs
for several releases.

If you add a new delayed-callback helper (or a new timer frame), route
errors the same way `EC_Delay` does. Do not add new bare `pcall` swallows.

### Delete-list seeding is deliberately empty

`EnsureDB()` still has a `_seededLists` one-shot flag, but the list it used
to seed (item IDs 300581 and 300574) was removed as stale cruft. Empty
delete list on first install is intentional. If a future scenario needs to
pre-populate specific IDs, use the `_seededLists` guard to avoid re-seeding
existing users.

### Stuck-Scavenger detection uses movement time, not distance

`UnitPosition("pet")` does not return data for CRITTER-type companions on
3.3.5a (the `"pet"` unit ID refers to combat pets only). An earlier
`EC_GetCompanionDistance` helper tried to use it but no-opped in practice.

The current detection path is in `EC_HandleScavengerOut`: a per-frame
accumulator (`EC_scavMovementAccum`) sums `elapsed` while the player is
moving (`GetUnitSpeed("player") > 0`) and the Scavenger is flagged as out.
When the accumulator crosses `EC_STUCK_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD` seconds the
addon dismisses the Scavenger and the next 5 s tick re-summons it at the
player's current position. The accumulator resets on every Scavenger
out↔in transition.

### Stuck detection has two signals; do not collapse them

The movement-time signal above misses kills-and-loots-in-place (AOE
channels, melee in one spot, tight kiting). A complementary signal lives
alongside it: `EC_GreedyEventFilter` records `EC_lastScavSpokeAt` on
every Scavenger speech, `LOOT_CLOSED` pushes timestamps into
`EC_recentLootTimes`, and `EC_IsLootSilenceStuck()` fires when the player
has looted at least 2 corpses inside 60 s without the Scavenger speaking
since the oldest. Both signals OR together inside `EC_HandleScavengerOut`;
the chat output distinguishes which fired so the user knows what happened.

The timestamp recording and the `LOOT_CLOSED` accumulator are both gated
on `DB.autoLootCycle` so cycle-off users pay nothing on the chat-event
path. `EC_recentLootTimes` is pruned in place on every check AND cleared
on Scavenger out↔in transitions in `EC_PetCheckTick`; both clears are
required (the prune bounds growth, the transition reset prevents an
immediate re-fire after a benign respawn).

If you add a third stuck signal, do it the same way: another OR clause
in `EC_HandleScavengerOut`, with its own state cleared on transitions,
and with cause-distinguishing chat output so the user can tell the
signals apart.

### `EC_IsPlayerBusy()` gates every CallCompanion the addon issues (v2.8.0+)

`CallCompanion` goes through WoW's spell-cast pipeline. If the player is
mid-cast, mid-channel, or moving when the addon fires it, the server
silently rejects the call (the spell can't queue into someone else's
cast slot) and *no error is raised*. Worse, on Project Ebonhold a
CRITTER summon issued while the player is moving spawns the pet but
never engages its follow AI -- the critter sits at the spawn point as a
zombie. Stationary heavy-DPS rotations and bag-full mid-combat both
hit this constantly.

`EC_IsPlayerBusy()` checks `UnitCastingInfo("player")`,
`UnitChannelInfo("player")`, and `GetUnitSpeed("player") > 0`. When any
of those are true, the call defers. Three places gate on it:

- `EC_TryResummonScavenger` -- the tick-driven retry path. When
  `EC_addonDismissed = true` and the player is busy, it returns
  without firing; the OnUpdate samples at 1 s instead of 5 s while
  the dismiss flag is set so the next clear window catches faster.
- `SummonGreedyScavenger` -- called from `EC_SummonGreedyWithDelay`
  after every merchant cycle. If busy, it sets `EC_addonDismissed
  = true` and bails out so the tick path picks up recovery.
- `EC_TickGoblinSummon` -- the bag-full Goblin Merchant summon path
  pushes its 1.5 s post-dismiss timer forward by 0.5 s if the player
  is busy, until a clear window opens.

`EC_TickGoblinTarget`'s retry budget (`EC_GOBLIN_MAX_RETRIES = 3`) is
the failure mode for the Goblin path: if three CallCompanion attempts
all miss (e.g. the cast-busy gate keeps firing them but the spell
system rejects them anyway under sustained casting), it gives up and
prints `Goblin Merchant failed to summon. Resuming looting.`.

`EC_IsPlayerBusy()` is defined just above `SummonGreedyScavenger` so
it's reachable as an upvalue from all three gate sites. Don't add a
fourth `CallCompanion` call site without routing it through the gate;
it will silently fail on lossy connections or during heavy combat.

The bare GCD from instant-cast abilities is *not* covered by the gate
(3.3.5a doesn't expose a clean GCD query). The retry-until-confirmed
loops (`EC_addonDismissed` stays true until `EC_PetCheckTick` observes
`scavengerOut = true` on the enumeration) and the Goblin retry budget
compensate.

### `EC_TryResummonScavenger` distinguishes leftover-goblin from user's pet (v2.8.0+)

The Goblin Merchant doesn't auto-dismiss when the merchant window
closes -- it lingers in the CRITTER slot for some time. The naive
`if anyPetOut then return end` guard (designed to respect the user's
manually-summoned bank mule / mailbox) treated this leftover goblin
as a user pet and refused to bring the Scavenger back. Forever.

`EC_PetCheckTick` now tracks a separate `goblinStillOut` flag in its
companion enumeration, set when the in-slot pet matches `TARGET_NAME`
or `GOBLIN_MERCHANT_SPELL_ID`. `EC_TryResummonScavenger` uses
`anyPetOut and not goblinStillOut` as the bail condition, so:

- Slot empty: proceed normally.
- Slot has the Scavenger: skip (already out).
- Slot has the goblin: dismiss it explicitly, then summon Scavenger.
- Slot has anything else (user's third-party companion): respect it.

Don't simplify back to "any pet out → respect"; the leftover goblin is
the common case after every bag-full cycle.

### Caches that mirror server-side state need a `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` bootstrap

`EC_lastScavengerOut` is a forward-declared local that mirrors
server-side companion state. Its declared default is `false`, but the
player can `/reload` with the Scavenger already summoned -- in which
case the gate stays false until the first 5 s tick observes the state.
The OnUpdate accumulator that gates on it then loses ~5 s of counting
-- which is exactly what made Test B fail during the v2.4 quality pass
before the bootstrap landed.

The fix lives in the `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` branch of the event hub:
a one-shot scan via `EC_FindGreedyScavenger()`, guarded by
`EC_scavStateBootstrapped` so it doesn't re-fire on every zone change.

If you add another local boolean that mirrors external/server state
(companion list, merchant list, group state, etc.), bootstrap it the
same way. Trusting the declared default works only when the addon
loaded *before* the state could exist -- which isn't true for `/reload`.

### Manual-dismiss is honoured implicitly: do not try to classify *why* the pet went away

v2.4.0 shipped an `EC_ClassifyScavengerTransition` helper that watched
every Scavenger out→not-out transition at the 5 s tick and used
`GetUnitSpeed("player")` as a heuristic to guess whether the player had
right-clicked the portrait (stationary → "manual dismiss") or the leash
had fired (moving → "auto-resummon"). It set an `EC_userDismissed` flag
that suppressed the re-summon path forever.

**v2.6.1 removed both the helper and the flag.** The premise was wrong:
plenty of non-manual reasons (server-side companion-duration timers,
brief disconnects, loading screens, phasing) cause the pet to despawn
while the player happens to be standing still. Each of those latched
`EC_userDismissed = true` permanently, and nothing the user did short
of an explicit `/ec` re-summon would clear it.

The new contract is simpler:

- `EC_addonDismissed` is the single source of truth. **We** set it when
  **we** dismiss (`DismissGreedyScavenger`, `EC_HandleScavengerOut`,
  the mount-up branch). Anything else -- manual portrait dismiss,
  server despawn, phase change -- leaves it `false`.
- `EC_TryResummonScavenger` only fires when `EC_addonDismissed == true`.
  This naturally honours manual dismisses and benign server despawns
  alike: the addon won't auto-resummon, but the user can trigger it
  themselves via `/ec` or the panel.

If you bring back any heuristic that wants to distinguish manual from
non-manual transitions, weigh the cost carefully. The previous
implementation broke for users on lossy connections; the simpler
"only auto-resummon what we dismissed" rule is correct.

### Mount handler must check actual companion state before dismiss/restore

`DismissGreedyScavenger()` unconditionally sets `EC_addonDismissed = true`
-- that's its contract. If the mount handler calls it when the Scavenger
isn't actually out, the flag is set on a no-op, and the unmount branch
then "restores" something the user actively dismissed.

The `UNIT_AURA` branch in the event hub:

- On mount: only dismiss if `EC_FindGreedyScavenger()` returns
  `isSummoned == true`.
- On unmount: only restore if `EC_addonDismissed`. The mount-up branch
  above is what protects manual-dismiss-before-mount: if the pet wasn't
  summoned at mount-up time, the dismiss is skipped and the flag stays
  `false`, so the dismount branch correctly leaves the pet alone.

If you add a similar dismiss-and-restore around another event
(instance load, vehicle entry, taxi flight), follow the same
"verify-then-act" gate pattern.

### `SummonGreedyScavenger` and `DismissGreedyScavenger` must sync cached state

These two helpers are the addon's authoritative summon/dismiss path.
They write to three module-level locals that the OnUpdate accumulator
and the re-summon gate read on every frame / every tick:

- `EC_addonDismissed` -- dismiss path sets true; summon path clears.
- `EC_lastScavengerOut` -- summon sets true, dismiss sets false. Syncs
  the stuck-detection gate immediately so the OnUpdate accumulator
  doesn't lag the next 5 s tick observation.
- `EC_scavMovementAccum` -- zero on either side; fresh count from the
  new state.

If you add another helper that summons or dismisses the Scavenger,
either call into these two helpers or set all three locals consistently.
A bare `CallCompanion("CRITTER", idx)` that bypasses
`SummonGreedyScavenger` will desync the gate and either over-fire
stuck detection or miss legitimate summons.

### `muteGreedy` is the master flag, not a sibling

In `EC_GreedyEventFilter` and the `EC_bubbleFrame` OnUpdate the
resolution is:

```lua
hideChat    = (DB.muteGreedy == true) or (DB.hideGreedyChat == true)
hideBubbles = (DB.muteGreedy == true) or (DB.hideGreedyBubbles == true)
```

`muteGreedy` ORs into both children. Unticking `hideGreedyChat` or
`hideGreedyBubbles` while `muteGreedy` is on does **nothing** -- the
master forces both children true. The Scavenger Settings panel
exposes all three checkboxes; users will reasonably expect them to be
independent and won't be (this tripped up testing during the v2.4
quality pass).

If you ever split these into truly independent flags, audit
`EC_GreedyEventFilter`'s tail (the `string.find` / `string.match` block
on the Scavenger-name path) and the bubble-kill OnUpdate's guard
accordingly.

### Cross-list conflicts are refused at input time, not just resolved post-hoc

`EC_ScanListConflicts` and `EC_ApplyCleanResolution` (driven by `/ec clean`)
sweep up items present on multiple lists with overlapping intent;
precedence is `blacklist > deleteList > whitelist`. They remain, but they
are a safety net for legacy DBs and imports rather than a routine cleanup
tool.

`EC_FindAddConflict` is the upstream guard. It runs at every add site:
the bag-context single-add inside `EC_AddItemToList`, the panel "Add by
ID" button in `CreateListUI`, the `AddMatchingFromBags` substring scan,
and the `ScanBagsForQuality` bulk-by-quality scan. It refuses adds that
would create a cross-intent conflict and prints which list already holds
the item. Same-intent scopes (per-character `whitelist` + account-wide
`accountWhitelist`, both intent "keep") do not conflict and the add
proceeds normally.

If you add another list or another scope, update both `EC_FindAddConflict`
(its `intentOf` map and the `checks` table) and `EC_ScanListConflicts` so
they stay in sync. Skipping the guard means silent post-hoc cleanups will
surprise the user; skipping the cleaner means legacy or imported data has
nowhere to be detected.

### Index of magic numbers

| Value | Location | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0.05s | vendor worker OnUpdate | Per-item pacing floor. Below this, the server boots you for packet spam. |
| 5s | `EC_PET_CHECK_INTERVAL` | Cadence for pet-check tick (state sync, stuck detection, re-summon). |
| 180s | `EC_STUCK_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD` | Player time-spent-moving after which the Scavenger is dismissed-and-resummoned (stuck-on-terrain detection). Was 20 s in v2.4-v2.6.0, briefly 60 s in early v2.6.1 testing, settled at 180 s after in-game UX feedback -- below that the dismiss fired during normal kill-loot-move questing cadence. |
| 60s | `EC_IsLootSilenceStuck` (inline `WINDOW`) | Window over which the loot-silence stuck signal evaluates. Player must have looted at least `MIN_LOOTS` corpses inside this window without hearing the Scavenger speak before the signal fires. |
| 2 | `EC_IsLootSilenceStuck` (inline `MIN_LOOTS`) | Minimum corpse loots inside the loot-silence window before the signal can fire. Floor of 2 prevents a single-corpse false positive. |
| 80 items | `maxItemsPerRun` | Sell-queue cap per run. Prevents the same disconnect risk as the vendor-interval floor. Recursive batching kicks in for larger inventories. |
| 1.5s | `EC_summonGoblinTimer` | Wait between dismiss and Goblin Merchant summon so the client has time to process the companion switch. |
| 2.0s | `EC_targetGoblinTimer` | Wait after summon before checking `isSummoned` via `GetCompanionInfo`. |
| 8.0s | `EC_merchantReminderTimer` | Gap before we remind the user to right-click the merchant (or use their keybind). |
| 10s | `EC_mountDismissTime` cooldown | Suppress pet re-summon within 10s of a mount-dismount to avoid cancelling the mount cast. |
| 600126 | `GOBLIN_MERCHANT_SPELL_ID` | Companion spell ID for the Goblin Merchant, used as the localisation escape hatch. |

## Fingerprint and watermark

EbonClearance carries a deliberate, visible fingerprint mechanism so
verbatim copies of the source or the export-string format can be
mechanically detected. Three pieces:

1. **`EC_FINGERPRINT_SALT`** at the top of `EbonClearance.lua`. A
   project-specific string. **Do not** "clean up", refactor, rename,
   or shorten this constant; its presence in code is the point. Any
   addon source containing this exact string is a verbatim copy.
2. **`EC_Fingerprint(payload)`** helper. djb2-style 24-bit hash
   folded into 6 hex chars, salted with the constant above. Used
   for both the watermark and export strings.
3. **`__EbonClearance_watermark`** global. Set at addon load to
   `EC_Fingerprint("EbonClearance@" .. ADDON_VERSION)`. Visible to
   `/run` and to external auditors. The hex value is reproducible:
   for any version, run the salted hash on
   `"EbonClearance@" .. version` and confirm.

Export strings carry a `;fp=<6 hex>` suffix produced by
`EC_Fingerprint` over the export payload. Imports tolerate strings
with or without the suffix (back-compat with hand-edited and
pre-fingerprint exports); imports do **not** verify the fingerprint
or warn on a bad one. The fingerprint exists to mark our exports
**going out**, not to police imports coming in.

Convention for future agents and contributors:

- Do not normalise, refactor, rename, or remove the salt constant
  or the helper. They are intentional artefacts.
- Do not add a fingerprint-verification step on import. This is a
  considered design choice (see `EC_StripFingerprint` and the
  comment above it).
- If we ever need a per-export-type fingerprint (profiles, settings,
  etc.), reuse `EC_Fingerprint` rather than introducing a second
  hash function. One salt, one helper, one mechanism.
- Section 2(d) of the LICENSE lists `__EbonClearance_watermark`
  alongside the other provenance globals as required-to-preserve in
  derivatives. Adding a new provenance global means updating
  LICENSE 2(d) and `NOTICE.md`.

The convergent prior-art story for the broader provenance pattern
(`__<addon>_origin` / `__<addon>_author`) is documented in
[`NOTICE.md`](../NOTICE.md). Read that before assuming we invented
either pattern.

## When to split the file

Keep the single-file layout until one of these is true:

- File exceeds ~8000 LOC. The original threshold here was ~4000 but
  was bumped post-v2.6.0 (file was 5561 LOC and the single-file
  architecture was working well; comprehension and grep latency
  weren't actually painful at that size). Re-evaluate at the next
  threshold rather than auto-splitting on growth alone.
- Two largely-independent features share almost no state. A clean
  module boundary appears organically; resist forcing one.
- We adopt Ace3, at which point AceAddon lifecycle encourages modules.

If you do split: introduce a `local EC = {}` namespace table in a new
`EbonClearance_Core.lua`, loaded first in the `.toc`, and have each
feature file attach to it. Do **not** split mid-feature - keep bag
code together, vendor code together, UI together.
