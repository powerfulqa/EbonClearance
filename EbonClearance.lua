-- Ebonhold companion NPCs. The defaults below are the enUS strings the
-- addon shipped with; v2.9.0 made them user-configurable via DB.merchantName
-- / DB.scavengerName so a realm with a renamed or localised pet can be
-- driven without forking. EnsureDB (and EC_compCache.refreshNames for UI
-- edits) writes back into these locals every time DB is re-read, and
-- PET_NAME_LC is recomputed alongside. Companion lookup is now ID-first via the cache
-- declared in the forward-decl block; the spellID 600126 fallback in
-- FindGoblinMerchantIndex remains the safety net for first-run resolution
-- when the cache is empty AND the merchant has been renamed in DB.

-- Build-time version. The release workflow's sed rule rewrites the
-- `local ADDON_VERSION = "vX.Y.Z"` line on each tag push (anchored
-- pattern fixed in v2.13.2), so the in-game UI surfaces (settings
-- panel header, bug-report builder, anything routed through EC_GetVersion)
-- always match the .toc on a release build. Dev checkouts keep
-- whatever real version the last release shipped; EC_GetVersion's
-- match check accepts any `^v%d+%.%d+%.%d+` value and short-circuits
-- to it. The fallback to GetAddOnMetadata exists for the legacy
-- placeholder case but is no longer reached on the current workflow.
-- Carrying the version here means a stale .toc cache (WoW only re-reads
-- .toc files on full client restart, not /reload) cannot make the displayed
-- version lie on a release build. The CI test in
-- tests/test_layout_reactivity.lua asserts this constant matches the
-- .toc Version field so any future drift fails CI before shipping.

-- v2.13.0 quest-item safety net. Returns true iff GetItemInfo classifies
-- the item as itemClass "Quest". Used by EC_IsSellable and BuildQueue's
-- delete branch to refuse auto-vendor / auto-delete on quest items even
-- when they're explicitly on the whitelist or delete list. Catches the
-- failure mode where a user added an item to a list months ago and then
-- later picked it up for a quest. Manual paths (Alt+Right-Click → Sell
-- Now / Delete Now) are NOT gated by this - those represent explicit
-- user intent. GetItemInfo's 6th return is the top-level item class
-- ("Armor", "Weapon", "Quest", "Consumable", etc.); "Quest" is the
-- enUS string and is what the localised client also returns here in
-- 3.3.5a (it's a category key, not display text).

-- Shared sell predicate. Used by BuildQueue to build the vendor queue and by

--   sellable (bool), link, sellPrice, itemCount.
-- `junkOnly` restricts matches to quality-0 items (used when the current
-- merchant mode disallows the whitelist/quality threshold).
--
-- INVARIANT: Grey items (quality == 0) with a positive sell price ALWAYS
-- match via isJunk, independent of DB.whitelist, DB.whitelistQualityEnabled,
-- or DB.whitelistMinQuality. The quality threshold only gates non-grey
-- items. Do not "simplify" the three independent passes (isJunk /
-- qualityPass / whitelistPass) into one combined check -- you will silently
-- break the grey-always-sold guarantee that users and docs rely on.
-- Blacklist and IsEquippedItem are the only things that can veto a sale.
