-- Salted, deterministic 24-bit hash. Not cryptographic; the goal is trivial
-- verifiability of EbonClearance origin in any derivative work. The salt
-- below is a deliberately visible signature: anyone with our source has it,
-- but to use our fingerprint format they must either (a) carry the salt
-- verbatim - which is the evidence - or (b) re-implement and diverge from
-- the canonical export format, also detectable. Do NOT "clean up" or
-- refactor the salt string away; its presence in code is the point. See
-- docs/ADDON_GUIDE.md "Fingerprint and watermark" for the full convention.
-- The salt lives inside the function body (not at module scope) only so it
-- doesn't consume a main-chunk local slot - Lua 5.1 caps that at 200.

-- Set-membership helper. Single canonical definition for the addon; the
-- consuming files (Vendor, Process, Tooltip, BagContextMenu, BagDisplay,
-- Events) bind it as `local IsInSet = NS.IsInSet` at file head so the
-- per-call cost is one local read, identical to the previous file-local
-- function pattern. Centralising the definition fixes the Stage 7
-- regression where one of the split files silently dropped its local
-- copy: `tests/test_perf_guardrails.lua` Test 65 still enforces the
-- per-file invariant via the `local IsInSet = ...` import line.
--
-- Strict semantics: only `true` or `1` count as membership. The pre-
-- unification BagDisplay and Vendor copies used a more permissive
-- `~= nil` check, but DB / ADB only ever stores `true` (verified by
-- audit), so the strict version is a no-op semantic narrowing on
-- current data and a safety improvement against hand-edited
-- SavedVariables.

--
-- scav / merch: the CRITTER companion list is keyed by creature ID at the
-- API level; matching on creatureName alone is brittle against rename /
-- localisation. We learn the ID on first successful name match and prefer
-- it on subsequent lookups, falling back to name + re-cache if the slot
-- reshuffles. Both nil means "not yet resolved this session".

-- pet's "summoned" flag flips out -> not-out without our own dismiss flag
-- set, and the transition lands within USER_WINDOW_S of that summon, we
-- treat it as a manual portrait click and suppress restore until userUntil.
-- Range-leash transitions take longer to surface, so the timing
-- distinguishes cleanly without misclassifying stationary casts. Restores
-- the discrimination v2.6.1 removed when it dropped the speed-based
-- classifier without a replacement.
