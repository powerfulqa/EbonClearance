# Spec: Item icons + hover tooltips on the four editable lists

**Date**: 2026-06-04
**Status**: Approved (brainstorming complete; awaiting implementation plan)
**Target release**: v2.41.0 (next minor - new user-facing UX feature, fully additive, no schema change)
**Touched files**: `EbonClearance_ListWidget.lua` (the only code file); docs sync in `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ADDON_GUIDE.md`, and (only if an existing entry reads wrong) `EbonClearance_HelpPanel.lua`

## Goal

Make the four editable item lists more interactive:

1. **Hover tooltip** - mousing over a list row brings up that item's full tooltip, anchored at the cursor.
2. **Icon instead of the ID number** - the green item ID currently shown at the start of each row is replaced by the item's icon.
3. **Quality-colored name** - the item name is colored to match its quality (white / green / blue / purple / etc.), so lists are easy to scan at a glance.

Scope is the four editable lists built by `CreateListUI`: **Sell List, Account Sell List, Keep List, Delete List**. The Process Bags queue, the personal Stats Top-5, and the Guild most-sold rows are explicitly out of scope (the Guild panel already has hover tooltips; the Stats Top-5 is a single multi-line text block, not real rows).

## Decisions locked (via brainstorming)

- **Scope:** the four editable `CreateListUI` lists only.
- **ID handling:** the green item ID is *fully replaced* by the icon. The raw ID is no longer rendered on the row. It remains reachable two ways that already exist: the list's Search box still matches on the ID string, and the hover tooltip shows the full item.
- **Implementation:** Approach A - extend the existing pooled row factory in place; reuse the `GetItemInfo` call that already runs per row; copy the Guild panel's hover pattern verbatim. No new helper abstraction (YAGNI), no Blizzard `ItemButton` rewrite.

## Architecture

All changes live in `EbonClearance_ListWidget.lua`, in two spots.

### 1. Row factory (`EC_compCache.makeListRowFactory` -> `getRow`)

Each pooled row gains one Texture plus hover wiring, created once at mint time and reused by the pool:

- `row.icon = row:CreateTexture(nil, "ARTWORK")`, size **18x18**, anchored `LEFT, row, LEFT, 2, 0`, with `SetTexCoord(0.07, 0.93, 0.07, 0.93)` to crop the stock icon border for a clean square.
- The existing `text` FontString re-anchors its LEFT from `row, LEFT, +2` to `row.icon, RIGHT, +4`. Its RIGHT -> `rm.LEFT` anchor is unchanged, so it still stretches with the (resizable) content frame.
- Hover wired once at mint, copying the Guild panel pattern (`EbonClearance_GuildPanel.lua`):
  - `row:EnableMouse(true)`
  - `OnEnter`: if `self.itemID` then `GameTooltip:SetOwner(self, "ANCHOR_CURSOR")`, `GameTooltip:SetHyperlink("item:" .. self.itemID)`, `GameTooltip:Show()`.
  - `OnLeave`: `GameTooltip:Hide()`.

### 2. Refresh loop (the per-row body, around the current line 481)

- Capture the icon texture **and quality** from the **existing** call (no new API call): `local name, _, quality, _, _, _, _, _, _, itemTexture = GetItemInfo(id)`.
- `row.icon:SetTexture(itemTexture or "Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_QuestionMark")` - question-mark fallback for not-yet-cached items.
- `row.itemID = id` so the already-wired `OnEnter` resolves the right tooltip.
- Quality-color the name only: `local qc = quality and ITEM_QUALITY_COLORS[quality]` then `local coloredName = qc and (qc.hex .. name .. "|r") or name`.
- Row text drops the green ID prefix and uses the colored name: `string.format("%s%s%s", coloredName, affixTag, procTag)` (was `"|cffb6ffb6%d|r  %s%s%s"`). The grey `(affix-gated)` and `(Hit-proc)` tags are unchanged (only the name portion is colored, so they still read as secondary).

## Edge cases (already handled by existing code)

- **Uncached item:** `name` is nil -> the existing tooltip-prime + `pendingRetry` path requeues a Refresh in 1.5 s. Until then the row shows the question-mark icon and the existing `ItemID: <n>` placeholder name (quality nil, so the placeholder stays uncolored). On retry icon, name, and color all fill in. No new logic.
- **Search / sort:** unchanged. Search still matches the ID string (the ID is simply not rendered anymore); the name-sort precompute is untouched.
- **Remove button / Clear All / reactive width:** untouched. The icon is fixed-size, so it introduces no `EC_PANEL_WIDTH` snapshot and no `test_layout_reactivity` concern. Reusing the existing `GetItemInfo` introduces no `test_perf_guardrails` concern.

## Testing

1. `luac -p EbonClearance_ListWidget.lua` (local syntax check).
2. All five invariant suites stay green: `test_layout_reactivity`, `test_perf_guardrails`, `test_comment_hygiene`, `test_comms_version`, `test_guildshare`. Before editing, grep the test files for any assertion pinned to the old `|cffb6ffb6` row-text format and update it in lockstep if one exists.
3. Repo grep for U+2014 returns zero.
4. In-game smoke on Ebonhold, for each of the four lists (Sell / Account Sell / Keep / Delete):
   - icons render for cached items;
   - an uncached item shows the question-mark icon, then fills in on the 1.5 s retry;
   - hovering a row shows the item tooltip at the cursor; moving off hides it;
   - Remove, Clear All, Search, and both sort buttons still work.

## Docs sync (project rule)

Player-facing visual change to existing lists; no new toggle, command, or schema:

- **CHANGELOG.md** - `### v2.41.0` stanza.
- **README.md** - one feature bullet: list rows now show item icons, quality-colored names, and a hover tooltip.
- **docs/ADDON_GUIDE.md** - one line under the list-widget description noting rows carry an icon, a quality-colored name, and a cursor-anchored hover tooltip.
- **EbonClearance_HelpPanel.lua** - touch only if an existing list-related FAQ entry would now read wrong; no new entry needed (no new control). Check during implementation.
- **CLAUDE.md** - no change (file count and test-invariant list both unchanged).
- **NOTICE.md** - no change.

## Version

`v2.41.0` - minor bump (new user-facing UX feature, fully additive, downgrade-safe).

## Out of scope

- Process Bags queue, personal Stats Top-5, Guild most-sold rows.
- Click / shift-click-to-link behaviour on rows (hover tooltip only).
- Keeping the raw ID visible on the row in any form.
