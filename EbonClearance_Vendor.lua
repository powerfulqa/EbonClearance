-- Stage 5 of the multi-stage file split tracked in docs/CODE_REVIEW.md
-- item 4. Stage 5 is deliberately scoped narrowly because the full vendor
-- cycle (EC_IsSellable, BuildQueue, DoNextAction, worker, StartRun,
-- EC_manualSell) has dense cross-file dependencies that warrant their
-- own future stages. This stage establishes the file with two pieces:
--
--   * The vendor-cycle state-machine constants and runtime state, which
--     were promoted onto EC_compCache during Stage 5 prep:
--       - EC_compCache.vendorRunning  (was file-scope local `running`)
--       - EC_compCache.pendingDelete  (was file-scope local of same name)
--     These initialise in EbonClearance_Core.lua's table literal. No code
--     lives in this file for them; they're documented here as the canonical
--     home for vendor-cycle state going forward.
--
--   * The deletion-confirmation popup hook (HookDeletePopupOnce). Self-
--     contained ~75 LOC subsystem with minimal cross-file dependencies.
--     The hook OnUpdate watches StaticPopup1 for DELETE_* variants and
--     auto-confirms when the queued deletion (EC_compCache.pendingDelete)
--     names an item on DB.deleteList. Exposed as NS.HookDeletePopupOnce
--     so EbonClearance_Events.lua's ADDON_LOADED branch can install it once.
--
-- Cross-file dependencies (read at call time):
--   * EC_compCache.pendingDelete - shared cache field, promoted Stage 5 prep
--   * NS.DB                      - SavedVariables, captured at function entry
--   * StaticPopup1{,Button1,EditBox}, MerchantFrame, etc. - WoW globals
--
-- DOES NOT include (future stage targets):
--   * EC_IsSellable, BuildQueue, FinishRun, DoNextAction, worker, StartRun,
--     EC_PreviewSellable, EC_IsMerchantAllowed (the merchant cycle itself)
--   * EC_manualSell (manual-sell attribution via hooksecurefunc)
--   * EC_compCache.isQuestItem helper
-- All of those stay in EbonClearance_Events.lua for now and will be extracted
-- in future stages when the cross-file plumbing for the helpers they
-- depend on (PrintNice, EC_Delay, EC_session, EC_lootCycleState, STATE,
-- EC_GetItemPrice, EC_IsAddonEnabledForChar, EC_RecordInventoryWorthSample,
-- EC_SummonGreedyWithDelay, EC_EffectiveMaxItemsPerRun,
-- EC_EffectiveVendorInterval, CopperToColoredText, EC_addonDismissed,
-- EC_RefreshSellBorders, ...) can be done deliberately.
