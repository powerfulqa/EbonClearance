-- Responsibility: event hub, slash commands, Bindings.xml handlers, and

-- the panel files together. ADDON_VERSION lives in this file; the
-- release workflow's sed rule (.github/workflows/release.yml) targets
-- it by filename. See docs/CODE_REVIEW.md "Resolved -> file split" for
-- the history of how this file got carved out of the original monolith.
--
-- Shared namespace for the addon. WoW passes (addonName, namespaceTable) as
-- the varargs to every .lua file in an addon; the same table is shared
-- across files. NS was first bootstrapped in Stage 1 of the file split and
-- has been the spine of every subsequent extraction. Reading or writing
-- NS.foo from any EbonClearance_*.lua file picks up the same table this
-- assignment creates. `select(2, ...)` is used instead of
-- `local addonName, NS = ...` because the main chunk is already at Lua
-- 5.1's 200-locals cap; capturing only the namespace (and not the addon
-- name string, which we don't use) spends one slot instead of two.
local NS = select(2, ...)

-- TARGET_NAME / PET_NAME hold the live display names of the two Project
-- Ebonhold companion NPCs. The defaults below are the enUS strings the
-- addon shipped with; v2.9.0 made them user-configurable via DB.merchantName
-- / DB.scavengerName so a realm with a renamed or localised pet can be
-- driven without forking. EnsureDB (and EC_compCache.refreshNames for UI
-- edits) writes back into these locals every time DB is re-read, and
-- PET_NAME_LC is recomputed alongside. Companion lookup is now ID-first via the cache
-- declared in the forward-decl block; the spellID 600126 fallback in
-- FindGoblinMerchantIndex remains the safety net for first-run resolution
-- when the cache is empty AND the merchant has been renamed in DB.

-- Build-time version. The release workflow's sed rule rewrites the

-- pattern fixed in v2.13.2), so the in-game UI surfaces (settings
-- panel header, bug-report builder, anything routed through EC_GetVersion)
-- always match the .toc on a release build. Dev checkouts keep
-- whatever real version the last release shipped; EC_GetVersion's
-- match check accepts any `^v%d+%.%d+%.%d+` value and short-circuits
-- to it. The fallback to GetAddOnMetadata exists for the legacy
-- placeholder case but is no longer reached on the current workflow.
-- Carrying the version here means a stale .toc cache (WoW only re-reads
-- .toc files on full client restart, not /reload) cannot make the displayed
-- version lie on a release build. The CI test in
-- tests/test_layout_reactivity.lua asserts this constant matches the
-- .toc Version field so any future drift fails CI before shipping.

-- updating the CI workflow's sed rule that targets this file by name

-- documented "per-character" semantics for the lists / profiles / per-mode
-- preferences were silently account-wide; every character on the account
-- shared the same Keep List, Sell List, Delete List, profile catalogue,
-- and the Process Bags ignore / collapsed-section state. Reported in-game
-- as the auto-Keep-equipped tag leaking onto a freshly-logged alt that
-- had never worn the item.
--
-- Fix without a .toc-directive change (which would risk cross-character
-- data loss because WoW serializes per-saved-variable-name): partition
-- inside the existing account-wide table.

--   * Top-level `EbonClearanceDB.<field>` stays as the legacy snapshot.
--     Reads / writes from current code never go here (the proxy routes
--     PER_CHAR_FIELDS to the per-character namespace). The snapshot is
--     the seed for newly-migrated characters AND the downgrade safety
--     net: a v2.33.x-or-earlier client looking for `DB.blacklist` etc.
--     still finds its pre-migration baseline at the top level.
--   * `EbonClearanceDB.chars[charKey]` holds each character's live data.
--     Each character gets a deep-copy of the snapshot on first load with
--     the new schema, then diverges from there.
--   * `DB` is a metatable proxy: PER_CHAR_FIELDS route to
--     `chars[charKey]`, everything else routes to the top level.

-- Test 66 in tests/test_perf_guardrails.lua locks the structural

-- v2.21.0: Fast Loot driver. Replaces v2.16.0's tight-loop drain
-- (which fired N LootSlot calls in one frame and risked anti-flood
-- disconnect on busy 3.3.5a private servers) with a queue + OnUpdate
-- throttle: on LOOT_READY, the slot indices are pushed into
-- EC_lootQueue.slots and the OnUpdate driver below drains one slot
-- every EC_LOOT_QUEUE_DELAY seconds. Each pop re-validates the slot
-- and pre-checks bag space before calling LootSlot. The 0.3 s
-- LOOT_READY debounce from v2.16.0 is gone - re-populating the queue
-- on a fresh LOOT_READY is idempotent (wipe + refill).
--
-- The "auto-loot is effectively on right now?" check is unchanged
-- from v2.16.0: autoLootDefault is the CVar setting, AUTOLOOTTOGGLE
-- is the modifier key (typically Shift) that inverts auto-loot for
-- one interaction. When the CVar's value matches whether the
-- modifier is held, auto-loot is OFF for this loot (user is
-- explicitly opting OUT - or didn't opt IN); when they differ,
-- auto-loot is ON. Skip when off so the user keeps the standard
-- loot window for selective looting.
--
-- BoP-bind auto-confirm (also v2.16.0) is unchanged: the
-- hooksecurefunc on LootSlot fires whether the call comes from the
-- old tight loop or the new queue. Fast Loot users still don't see
-- the bind popup.

-- v2.16.0: Fast Loot BoP-bind auto-dismiss. When Fast Loot is on and the
-- user loots a Bind-on-Pickup item, Blizzard normally shows a LOOT_BIND
-- popup asking "are you sure?". That popup blocks the rest of the loot
-- queue draining and defeats the point of Fast Loot. This hook auto-
-- confirms each LootSlot call and force-hides the popup. Self-gates on
-- DB.fastLoot at call time so non-Fast-Loot users keep the Blizzard
-- safety prompt. Idempotent: the hookedOnce guard makes a second call
-- cheap if anything ever calls this twice. Pattern borrowed from
-- LootClicker (others/LootClicker-master/core.lua:158-161).

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Panel-text principle (v2.20.2)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Panel descriptions (yellow MakeLabel) and grey checkbox notes
-- (|cff888888...|r) should answer one of three questions for the
-- player:
--   1. What does this do?
--   2. When does it apply?
--   3. How do I override it?
-- If a sentence explains WHY a feature exists, cites version history,
-- or names an internal mechanism, cut it. The player doesn't care; we
-- have CLAUDE.md and source comments for that. Same lens applies when
-- adding a new toggle or panel description.

-- carried a luacheck:ignore suppression because no caller existed since
-- before v2.13.0. If a future opt-in vendor button is desired, build it
-- fresh on top of EC_CreateTargetMerchantButton (the existing combat-safe
-- SecureActionButton helper) rather than reviving this dead surface.
