-- Build-time version. The release workflow's sed rule rewrites the

-- pattern fixed in v2.13.2), so the in-game UI surfaces (settings
-- panel header, bug-report builder, anything routed through EC_GetVersion)
-- always match the .toc on a release build. Dev checkouts keep
-- whatever real version the last release shipped; EC_GetVersion's
-- match check accepts any `^v%d+%.%d+%.%d+` value and short-circuits
-- to it. The fallback to GetAddOnMetadata exists for the legacy
-- placeholder case but is no longer reached on the current workflow.
-- Carrying the version here means a stale .toc cache (WoW only re-reads
-- .toc files on full client restart, not /reload) cannot make the displayed
-- version lie on a release build. The CI test in
-- tests/test_layout_reactivity.lua asserts this constant matches the

-- v2.19.0: PE roguelite affix detection
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Project Ebonhold randomly applies suffix-style affixes to items (e.g.
-- `Thorbia's Gauntlets of Fortified by Pain IV` shares the base itemID
-- with the plain `Thorbia's Gauntlets` but adds a random " of X" suffix
-- and a proc effect). EC needs to detect affixed instances so the
-- Sell-List / Delete-List itemID match doesn't accidentally dump them.
--
-- Two-layer detection:
--   1. linkHasAffix(link)         - parses the 7th field of the item
--      link (suffix-DBC ID). Non-zero means the standard 3.3.5a random
--      property/suffix system fired on this instance. Cheap; one regex.
--   2. bagSlotHasAffix / liveTooltipHasAffix - fallback that compares
--      the live tooltip's title (TextLeft1) to GetItemInfo's base name.
--      If they differ, the title has extra text appended - affix
--      detected. Covers the case where PE uses a custom mechanism that
--      doesn't touch the link's suffix slot. Slightly more expensive
--      (tooltip scan) but only fires when Layer 1 returned false.
function EC_compCache.linkHasAffix(link)

    -- The 7th numeric field is the suffix-DBC ID. Positive =
    -- ItemRandomProperties.dbc, negative = ItemRandomSuffix.dbc, zero
    -- = no random property. We only care about non-zero.

-- returned true on ANY non-zero suffix-DBC field (Layer 1) OR any
-- tooltip-title that differed from GetItemInfo's base name (Layer 2),
-- which conflated PE roguelite affixes with standard 3.3.5a random
-- suffixes (`of the Bear`, `of the Sorcerer`, etc.). Bug: standard
-- random-suffix items were being protected as if they were PE
-- roguelite affixes, blocking legitimate vendor sales.
--
-- Discriminator: PE roguelite affixes always end with a roman-numeral
-- rank (I, II, III, IV, ...). Standard ItemRandomSuffix.dbc entries
-- don't. So both checks now require BOTH "tooltip title differs from
-- base name" AND "tooltip title ends with a roman-numeral rank".

-- v2.23.0: PE engraving / affix integration
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PE affixes (the rank-suffixed "of Inner Light II"-style names on
-- Rare/Epic items) are backed by engraving spells in the player's
-- spellbook. After extracting an affix, the engraving spell is
-- learned; its tooltip reads "Allows you to engrave this affix on
-- any equippable item: <effect text>".
--
-- The matchable identifier is the EFFECT TEXT (e.g. "Increases your
-- total Spirit by 6%."), which appears verbatim:
--
--   * On the bag item's tooltip, wrapped in literal `@affix@`
--     markers on one of the lines below the item stats.
--   * On the engraving spell's tooltip, after the "Allows you to
--     engrave this affix on any equippable item: " prefix.
--
-- Rank is naturally encoded in the description ("by 3%" vs "by 6%"),
-- so a description-match implicitly does an exact-rank dupe check -
-- exactly the semantics the user wanted.
--
-- This indirection is necessary because the item-suffix name
-- ("of Inner Light") and the engraving-spell name ("Spirit Surge")
-- are unrelated strings in PE's data model.
--
-- We do not use ProjectEbonhold.PerkService.GetGrantedPerks() - that
-- returns RUN-PERK echoes ("Agility Boost", "Warm-Blooded", etc.),
-- a different system from item affixes.

-- v2.20.0: PE Chance-on-hit detection
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Project Ebonhold lets players EXTRACT proc spells from weapons (the
-- green `Chance on hit:` tooltip line) and apply them to other items.
-- So an item with a Chance-on-hit proc is meaningfully different from
-- the base itemID even when the user has the base itemID on their
-- Sell List or Delete List. EC_compCache.itemHasChanceOnHit /
-- liveTooltipHasChanceOnHit are the detection helpers; gated by
-- DB.protectChanceOnHitItems in EC_IsSellable and BuildQueue's
-- delete fallback.
--
-- Caching: chance-on-hit is a STABLE per-itemID property (unlike
-- random-affix instances), so a per-itemID boolean cache is correct
-- and efficient. EC_compCache.chanceOnHitCache holds the result; it
-- resets naturally on /reload because EC_compCache itself isn't
-- persisted across sessions.
-- v2.26.0: two-phrasing match. PE items carry chance-on-hit procs in
-- two flavours: the classic `Chance on hit: ...` (Bloodpike-style)
-- and the older PPM-style `Equip: Chance to <verb>... ...`
-- (Quillshooter-style). Both should land under the same protection,
-- so the detector scans for either pattern.
-- Hung on EC_compCache (not a file-scope local) to stay under Lua
-- 5.1's 200-locals cap.

-- v2.21.0: Fast Loot driver. Replaces v2.16.0's tight-loop drain

-- disconnect on busy 3.3.5a private servers) with a queue + OnUpdate
-- throttle: on LOOT_READY, the slot indices are pushed into
-- EC_lootQueue.slots and the OnUpdate driver below drains one slot
-- every EC_LOOT_QUEUE_DELAY seconds. Each pop re-validates the slot
-- and pre-checks bag space before calling LootSlot. The 0.3 s
-- LOOT_READY debounce from v2.16.0 is gone - re-populating the queue
-- on a fresh LOOT_READY is idempotent (wipe + refill).
--
-- The "auto-loot is effectively on right now?" check is unchanged
-- from v2.16.0: autoLootDefault is the CVar setting, AUTOLOOTTOGGLE
-- is the modifier key (typically Shift) that inverts auto-loot for
-- one interaction. When the CVar's value matches whether the
-- modifier is held, auto-loot is OFF for this loot (user is
-- explicitly opting OUT - or didn't opt IN); when they differ,
-- auto-loot is ON. Skip when off so the user keeps the standard
-- loot window for selective looting.
--
-- BoP-bind auto-confirm (also v2.16.0) is unchanged: the
-- hooksecurefunc on LootSlot fires whether the call comes from the
-- old tight loop or the new queue. Fast Loot users still don't see
-- the bind popup.

-- ===========================================================================
-- Sellability trace: per-item predicate inspector
-- ===========================================================================
-- Walks the same decision chain EC_IsSellable runs, in the same order, and
-- emits a chat-line trace explaining which predicates passed / failed for a
-- given bag slot. Surfaced two ways:
--   * /ec sellinfo [bag] [slot] — defaults to the first non-empty bag slot
--   * Alt+Shift+Right-Click on a bag item — uses the existing
--     ContainerFrameItemButton_OnModifiedClick override path
--
-- The trace mirrors EC_IsSellable's logic deliberately rather than calling
-- into it because the goal is a per-step explanation, not the final boolean.
-- Both paths read the same DB fields and EC_compCache helpers so the trace
-- can't disagree with the live decision unless one falls out of sync; if you
-- touch EC_IsSellable, update this helper alongside.

-- alongside the original Keep-List auto-protect toggles).
-- ============================================================
-- Holds the auto-protect toggles + explanatory notes that previously
-- cluttered the Keep List panel. Schema and behaviour are identical to the
-- pre-v2.15.0 surfacing; this is purely a visual split for consistency with
-- the other list panels' rhythm. The toggles still write to the same DB
-- fields (DB.autoAddEquipped, DB.autoProtectUpgrades, DB.autoProtectEquipmentSets)
-- and still call the same sync helpers (EC_compCache.syncEquipped /
-- checkBagsForUpgrades / syncEquipmentSets), so the PLAYER_EQUIPMENT_CHANGED
-- and EQUIPMENT_SETS_CHANGED reactive paths in the event hub continue to
-- drive the same protection without any wiring changes.
